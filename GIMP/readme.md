When we saved the file, it saved as ```.xcf```. This way, we can save the file with all the layers, and can edit the file again with GIMP. However, if we want to save it as normal picture, we have to ``` Export ``` it. Go to ``` File ``` and click Export. You can also type ``` Ctrl E ``` with the keyboard to export.
